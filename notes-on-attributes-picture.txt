Experimenting with picture
Normally the path to a .tif image file, i.e.  /Library/User Pictures/Animals/Parrot.tif

Looks like modifications to the picture require a reboot (maybe not!)

Try changing it to /etc/passwd: ignored.
Try a URL to an image: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russulaceae#/media/File:Russula_emetica_117475.jpg - ignored


Oddly, when trying to fix this Picture value by editing my profile picture through the Accounts interface, it just deleted the key...

Not really sure what this value does yet. It doesn't seem to actually affect the profile picture used. Can probably also be used to store arbitrary data.

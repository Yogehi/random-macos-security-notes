These attributes are readable from the admin user as root:

dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_AvatarRepresentation
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_hint
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_jpegphoto
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_passwd
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_picture
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_realname
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_unlockOptions
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_UserCertificate
dsAttrTypeNative:accountPolicyData
dsAttrTypeNative:AvatarRepresentation 
dsAttrTypeNative:HeimdalSRPKey
dsAttrTypeNative:KerberosKeys
dsAttrTypeNative:ShadowHashData
dsAttrTypeNative:unlockOptions
AppleMetaNodeLocation
AuthenticationAuthority
AuthenticationHint (dsAttrTypeNative:hint, hint)
GeneratedUID
JPEGPhoto (dsAttrTypeNative:jpegphoto, jpegphoto)
NFSHomeDirectory
Password (dsAttrTypeNative:passwd, passwd)
Picture (dsAttrTypeNative:picture, picture)
PrimaryGroupID
RealName
RecordName
RecordType
UniqueID
UserShell

(Note: Some attributes can be referred to in multiple ways and are listed in parentheses after the name separated by commas. Unless otherwise specified, the keys are interchangeable. It is presumed, but not yet confirmed, that each attribute has both a "dsAttrTypeNative" name and a friendly name)

Of the above, the following keys are NOT readable by the admin user (himself):

dsAttrTypeNative:HeimdalSRPKey
dsAttrTypeNative:KerberosKeys
dsAttrTypeNative:ShadowHashData
AppleMetaNodeLocation
RecordType

Of the above, the following keys ARE readable by the admin user (himself):

dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_AvatarRepresentation
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_hint
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_jpegphoto
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_passwd
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_picture
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_realname
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_unlockOptions
dsAttrTypeNative:_writers_UserCertificate
dsAttrTypeNative:accountPolicyData
dsAttrTypeNative:AvatarRepresentation 
dsAttrTypeNative:unlockOptions
AuthenticationAuthority
AuthenticationHint
GeneratedUID
JPEGPhoto
NFSHomeDirectory
Password
Picture
PrimaryGroupID
RealName
RecordName
UniqueID
UserShell

For those keys that are readable, the following are WRITEABLE by the admin user (himself):

dsAttrTypeNative:AvatarRepresentation
dsAttrTypeNative:hint
dsAttrTypeNative:jpegphoto
dsAttrTypeNative:passwd
dsAttrTypeNative:picture
dsAttrTypeNative:unlockOptions

MUST use the following key names to use the 'change' action, cannot do so with the "dsAttrTypeNative" names for some reason:

AuthenticationHint
JPEGPhoto
Password
Picture

(Note: Values of these keys can be written to, appended, changed, deleted, etc. through `dscl` without additional prompting for the user, thus these may be interesting for post-exploitation)
(Note: When using 'change' to change the password hint for a user, I needed to use "AuthenticationHint" instead of "hint")
(I do not believe the above indicates these keys are aliased to one another, as you can change the value of "Password" to update "passwd" but "Password" itself will still reflect 8 asterisks, unless that's being forced by another layer of the application)

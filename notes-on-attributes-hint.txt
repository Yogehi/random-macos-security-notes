Experimenting with writing data to dscl attributes:

Can 'delete' "hint" but cannot 'create' it
This can be recreated by simply updating the user's password through System Preferences -> Users & Groups with the hint as desired.

Hint displays in a small dialogue box that pops up after 3 failed attempts (or by clicking the ? next to the input field before entering anything)
HTML: <html><h1>Test</h1></html> - Doesn't work
Special characters (no \): ~!@#$%^&*()_+`-=<>?{}|:",./;'[] - Doesn't work
Lots of characters: AAAA x (8*8*8) (with a B at the end) - Rejected without a warning message if done through user interface; allowed through dscl

Same as above but through dscl: "A" + the above 'append'ed results in just an A displaying to the user, but the data itself remains in dscl - In fact anything I 'append' to this is hidden from the display but available in dscl (initial hint set through user interface) 

I accidentally entered the following:
dscl . append /Users/admin hint C "; some bash command"
and now the hint displays as
A
B
C
C
; some bash command
Note it is now being displayed vertically ('xxd' confirms newline characters 0x0a have been appended to each entry). No change to output displayed to user - still only says "A" (the Bs and Cs were also 'appended' as above). The bash commanded does NOT execute.

This seems to be caused by appending content wrapped in quotes with a space, i.e. " command" or "; command", etc. I suspect this is to allow easy splitting of this value (spaces before, newlines after), but I don't know WHY this is necessary.

For shits and giggles, you can do:
`/usr/bin/dscl /Local/Default read /Users/admin hint | sh -`
to execute any commands you might append to the hint. Again, hidden from the user at login prompt.
